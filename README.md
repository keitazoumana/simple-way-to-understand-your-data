# A Simple-way-to-understand-your-data   

This is a repository to help understand the basics related to data analysis. It has been created using the famous 
titanic dataset, available on kaggle. 
You will notice along your data science journey the importance of understanding your data first, before going through
the creation of any machine learning model. The better you understand your data, the better your models you will understand 
which machine learning algorithm to use.

## Goal of this repo  
* Help you analyse your dataset. 
* Understand the problem that is being solved before try to write any code.   
* Have a simple explanation to demonstrate the logic used in the exploratory data analysis process.   

## What you will learn ?  
* import libraries using ***import*** function.   
* read your data using ***pandas*** library.   
* determine the number of features and observations using ***df.shape*** function.  
* describe your ***pandas.DataFrame()*** with ***df.describe()*** and ***df.column_name.value_counts()***  
* perform univariate analysis technics like ***Probability Density Function (PDF)***, ***Cumulative Density Function (CDF)***  
***boxplot*** and ***violin plot***.  
* numerical and categorical column vectorization
